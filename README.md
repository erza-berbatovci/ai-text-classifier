-  Sports  
-  Business  
-  Sci/Tech

##  Features  
- Data loading & preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal, lowercasing)  
- Exploratory analysis (class distribution, frequent words)  
- Model training with Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes  
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)  
- Prediction function for new text inputs  
- Visualization: class distribution and confusion matrix
